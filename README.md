## Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm Lucas Garay, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Big Data Health Science at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [National University of CÃ³rdoba](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) in Argentina. Additionally, I had the opportunity to be a visiting student at [Dongseo University](https://uni.dongseo.ac.kr/eng/).

My passion lies in the application of Artificial Intelligence to the healthcare domain. I've previously worked on projects related to [Medical Image Processing for Automatic Report Generation](https://github.com/lggaray/Medical_Report_Generation) and had an internship at [Nanjing University Science Park](http://www.njusp.com/), where I contributed to advancements in Medical Image Processing.
